    <h1>What about this poem?</h1>
    
    
    <p>This is a poem about living every moment in your life is priceless and living in the moment without thinking about tomorrows.</p>
    
    <h2>Each moment is precious</h2>
    
    <p>Live in the moment,<br>
Just take it all in.<br>
Pay attention to everything, <br>
Right there and right then. <br>
Don’t let your mind wander <br>
To what’s coming next. <br>
Cherish this moment <br>
And give it your best. <br>
Don’t let tomorrow <br>
Make you rush through today,<br>
Or too many great moments <br>
Will just go to waste. <br>
And the person you’re with, <br>
In that moment you share, <br>
Give them all of your focus; <br>
Be totally there. <br>
Laugh till it hurts, <br>
Let the tears drop. <br>
Fill up each moment <br>
With all that you’ve got. <br>
Don’t miss the details; <br>
The lesson is there. <br>
Don’t get complacent; <br>
Stay sharp and aware. <br>
It can take but a moment <br>
To change your life’s path. <br>
And once it ticks by, <br>
There is no going back. <br>
In just 60 seconds, <br>
You may make a new friend. <br>
Find your true love, <br>
Or see a life start or end. <br>
You become who you are <br>
In those moments you live. <br>
And the growth’s not in taking <br>
But in how much you give. <br>
Life is just moments, <br>
So precious and few. <br>
Whether valued or squandered, <br>
It’s all up to you!</p>
